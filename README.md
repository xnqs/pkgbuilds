# My PKGBUILDs
All of my custom PKGBUILDs for any Arch-based distros.

Right now the following are available:
- obs-kmsgrab-xnqs-git: my fork of w23's obs-kmsgrab, makes it compatible with the latest version of OBS
- obs-studio-xnqs-git: patched version of obs-studio-git that works with obs-kmsgrab
- turbofetch: my custom fetch script that aims to be as fast as possible, while also looking very good
